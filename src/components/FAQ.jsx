                    <h2>Dress Code & Parking</h2>
                    <p>The dress code is formal attire, no tuxedos required. All events will be inside,
                        so no need to worry about the heat! And all venues have plenty of parking for those
                        who plan to drive.

                    <p>We've reserved a block of rooms at X hotel in Weston, FL. When you make a reservation,
                        let the hotel know you are part of the Gaya-Sanchez wedding to receive the discount. You are 
                        also welcome to stay anywhere you like within the area!

                    <p>For guests arriving from out of town, we recommend arranging a carpool with other family members or Ubering where possible. 
                        If you need more transportation arrangements, please reach out to us.

                    <h2>Gift Registry</h2>
                    <p>Your presence is truly the best gift we could ask for, nothing more required! But if you would still like 
                        to provide us an extra gift, we've put together a honeymoon fund as well as a small registry. We would be 
                        very happy if you contributed to either. Link to the fund: (link here). Link to the registry: (link here)
